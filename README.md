Using the correct values for the corresponding algorithm, the metrics have been optimised.
These models are designed to provide high-accuracy forecasts for energy storage systems. Predicting demand patterns and storage energy needs, they enable energy films to:
1) Better Decision-Making on when to store or release energy
2) Minimize Costs using the results of predictions
3) Data-Driven decisions for possible investments
